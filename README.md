# go-deribit

## No longer maintained

I do not have the time to look after this project. It was good fun but all good things must end. If you wish to carry on then please fork this repo and go your own way.

## V3 

This project is now using go1.13 with Go Modules, but should remain compatible with `dep`. Also, as there are some breaking changes introduced by the latest schema changes from the remote API, I have decided to carry on development in the new `v3` namespace with the project root containing the code tagged `v2.x`.

`import "github.com/omani/go-deribit/v3"`

We now have the latest API methods which were recently released such as `public/get_tradingview_chart_data`.

I recommend using the `v3` project in your projects as all onward development will now be within this project.

## Overview

Go library for using the [Deribit's](https://www.deribit.com/reg-3027.8327) **v2** Websocket API. 

Deribit is a modern, fast BitCoin derivatives exchange. 

This library is a port of the [official wrapper libraries](https://github.com/deribit) to Go.

## Example Usage

Look at `cmd/example/main.go`

```
make build
example --access-key XXX --secret-key YYYYYY
```

## Reconnect Behaviour

There is a heartbeat which triggers every 10 seconds to keep the websocket connection alive. In the event of a connection error, the library will automatically attempt to reconnect, re-authenticate and reestablish subscriptions.

This behaviour is overrideable with the `SetDisconnectHandler` method.

```
// Example reconnect code
exchange.SetDisconnectHandler(func (core *deribit.RPCCore) {
    exg := &deribit.NewExchangeFromCore(true, core)
	log.Warn("Disconnected from exchange. Attempting reconnection...")
	if err := exg.Connect(); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Error re-connecting to exchange: %s", err)
	}
	log.Info("Reconnected")
})
```

## Logging

The standard logger has been used within the library. You can plug this into your own application's logger by overriding the output io.Writer.

```
logger := logrus.New()
exchange.SetLogOutput(logger.Writer())
```

## Development

The `models` and `client` directories are where all the requests and responses are stored. The contents is automatically generated from the `schema` directory by `go-swagger`.

If you need to rebuild these use `make generate-models`.

The RPC subscriptions are also auto-generated. Use `make generate-methods` to rebuild these. They are in `rpc_subscriptions.go`.
